## Introduction
This is my Counter Strike: Global Offensive configuration. It's based on
Hiko's setup originally. There's nothing special here. There is a setup script
if you are a linux user.

## Getting Started
If you wish to keep your existing config, copy your config files over those in
`profiles/my_profile`.

Then run the setup script:
```
sh setup
```

If you want to try another available profile, execute the script with the `-p`
flag:
```
sh setup -p GeT_RiGhT
```

## To-dos:
- add a bunch of player profiles
- cases where configs include/exclude other config files. ie. userconfig.cfg
- make default user profile truly a vanilla setting
- fuzzy profile name matching
- mac support
- list available profiles
- import a user's existing config
