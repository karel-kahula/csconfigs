## Introduction
This is my Counter Strike: Global Offensive configuration. It's based on
Hiko's setup originally. There's nothing special here. There is a setup script
if you are a linux user.

## To-dos:
- add a bunch of player profiles
- cases where configs include/exclude other config files. ie. userconfig.cfg
- make default user profile truly a vanilla setting
- fuzzy profile name matching
- mac support
- list available profiles
