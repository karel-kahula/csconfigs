## Introduction
This is my Counter Strike: Global Offensive configuration. It's based on
Hiko's setup originally. There is a setup script if you are a linux user. Use
at your own risk.

## Getting Started
If you wish to keep your existing config, copy your config files over those in
`profiles/my_profile`.

Then run the setup script:
```
./setup.py
```
If you want to try another available profile, execute the script with the `-p`
flag:
```
./setup.py -p GeT_RiGhT
```
Want to see which profiles are available?
```
./setup.py -l
```

## To-dos
- add a bunch of player profiles
- fuzzy profile name matching
- mac support
- import a user's existing config
- eliminate my use of the config.cfg file
- handle all named files in a profile (allows for custom scripts)
